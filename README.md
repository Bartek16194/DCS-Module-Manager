# DCS-Module-Manager
PowerShell GUI application for DCS World that lets users easily select, install, or uninstall modules. It remembers the DCS installation path, categorizes modules by type and developer, generates DCS_updater commands, verifies success by re-reading the autoupdate.cfg, and provides access to logs on failure.
